Chapter 1: Object-Oriented Design 

- procedural software: 
    - you know the order of events
    - you can write code to do each things
    - you can deliberately string the things together, one after another
    - ex: morning routine, time/event flow
- object-oriented: 
    - each object comes with it's own behavior
    - objects can interact with each out
    - the outcomes of some interactions are predictable but other are not 
        - if you put a cat object and a person object into a room together, if the person accidently steps on the cat-- everyone's heart rate would go up 
        - in the world of object-oriented design, we don't have to explicitly write code for the `person_steps_on_cat`, we can simply put these two objects in a room together for unexpected behaviors to appear
